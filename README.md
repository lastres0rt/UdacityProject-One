# One-Page Portfolio
##  Udacity Project One
A portfolio site coded up with HTML and CSS for the Udacity Front-End Developer Nanodegree.

The site is intended to demonstrate my skills with code slicing (taking an image and translating it into a website). It is also intended to show my understanding of CSS frameworks.
