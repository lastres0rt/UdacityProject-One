# Udacity Project One (One-Page Portfolio)

![Part of the Udacity Front-End Web Development Nanodegree](https://img.shields.io/badge/Udacity-Front--End%20Web%20Developer%20Nanodegree-02b3e4.svg) 🎓

A portfolio site coded up with HTML and CSS. 📚

The site shows off my skills with code slicing (taking an image and translating it into a website). It is also intended to show my understanding of CSS frameworks. 🔪

This single-page portfolio also uses elements of Bootstrap and jQuery.
